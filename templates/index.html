                <h4>The Future of Books = the Web</h4>
                    <p>No one owns the idea of a book, but somehow (historical reasons) the word ebook is almost synonymous with the Kindle.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>FuturePress aims to free content from the prisons of current proprietary formats through building awesome open source technology and utilizing powerful web standards. All our code is licensed under the incredibly permissive Free BSD license.</p>
<!--                     <p>This paper offers a vision of digital book distribution based on open web standards, shows solutions implementing these standards, and discusses the possibilities such technological stacks can enable. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has championed open standards to create a content publishing system that is extensible, configurable, and compatible across browsers, applications and devices. We argue digital books should be built with and distributed by these same open standards. We discuss how “books as web resources” will bring a number of efficiencies, new affordances, and benefits for multiple stakeholders in the information economy. The benefits discussed include open annotation, linking inside of books, interoperability, decentralized distribution, and syndication. We present a technology stack built on these standards, and offer a use case showing how this architecture can be used to support new ways of creating, distributing, and monetizing content.</p> -->

          <p class="lead">By publishing with the open standards Epub and OPDS, authors can take part in decentralized distribution where a book listing on their own server can support an unlimited number of listings in other locations or with larger distributors. For example, a book review on a personal blog might embed the author’s book into the review, allowing the review reader to sample different sections of the text, as well as acting as an additional distribution point. In another example, ebook retailers, such as Feedbooks, can act as aggregators of content while the book listing itself is sourced from the author’s own server.</p>
